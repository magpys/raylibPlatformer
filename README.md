# Raylib Platformer Playground

This is a platformer playground project written in C using raylib library.

The aim of this project is to let me learn both raylib and C, to work out if I am capable of, and would enjoy, making larger games using these technologies.

## How to run

Fairly new to C so perhaps not the best person to answer that question.

The rough steps are:
* Download raylib
* Build the project (CMakeLists.txt included should help with that)
* Run the exe.
